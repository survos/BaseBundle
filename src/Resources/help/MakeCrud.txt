The <info>%command.name%</info> command generates crud controller with templates for selected entity.

The entity must define a unique identifiers method (e.g. id, slug), which is used for the ParamConverter.

Templates extend a base specific to the entity.

<info>php %command.full_name% BlogPost</info>

If the argument is missing, the command will ask for the entity class name interactively.
